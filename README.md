# Presentations
I am a SQL Server Data Engineer.  I have had the opportunity to speak about various topics and want to share the code that I demonstrate as well as the slides that I display.

Please feel free to use the code as you please.  There is no warranty on this code.

The slides are available for your learning.  Please don't use them as your own without attribution.
