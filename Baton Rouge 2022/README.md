# Baton Rouge 2022
On Aug 6, 2022, I had the privilege of speaking at the [Baton Rouge SQL Saturday 2022](https://sqlsaturday.com/2022-08-06-sqlsaturday1026/).
This was a live event.  I gave an "Introduction to Azure Synapse Studio Development Tools".

This is a copy of the code that I used in my demonstration as well as the slides.  I used files from https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/2017/1-Year/csv_hus.zip.
You will need to stand up an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace and upload the csv files from the zip file to the associated Azure Data Lake Gen 2.

Please feel free to use the code as you please.  There is no warranty on this code.

The slides are available for your learning.  Please don't use them as your own without attribution.

This was the abstract:

## Introduction to Azure Synapse Studio Development Tools
Azure Synapse Studio provides tools for working with data in a variety of formats. This session introduces the development tools in Azure Synapse Studio.

We will first look at the SQL editor. You will see how you can leverage your existing T-SQL skills to view delimited file data. We will save the queries you write for future work.

We will then look at using Notebooks to work with delimited data. You will see how easy it is to document your work, entering formatted descriptions of what your code should do and storing the results of running your code. You will see how you can work with different languages from Python to SQL to Scala and even .Net.

We will touch on various templates that Microsoft provides. There is no need to start from scratch.
