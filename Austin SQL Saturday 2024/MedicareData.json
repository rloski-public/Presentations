Medicaid managed care programs on a plan-specific level. The managed care enrollment statistics include enrollees receiving comprehensive benefits and limited benefits and are point-in-time counts.\r\n\r\n1. Because Medicaid beneficiaries may be enrolled concurrently in more than one type of managed care program (e.g., a Comprehensive MCO and a BHO), users should not sum enrollment across all program types, since the total would count individuals more than once and, in some states, exceed the actual number of Medicaid enrollees.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n2. Comprehensive MCOs cover acute, primary, and specialty medical care services; they may also cover behavioral health, long-term services and supports, and other benefits in some states. Limited benefit managed care programs, including MLTSS only, BHO, Dental, Transportation, and Other cover a narrower set of services.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n3.

Consumers who submitted applications to an SBM that can be matched to a Medicaid\/CHIP record are also included. See the \u0022Data Sources and Metrics Definition Overview\u0022 at http:\/\/www.medicaid.gov for a full description of the differences between the SBM operating systems and resulting data metrics, measure definitions, and general data limitations. As of the September 2023 report, this table was updated to differentiate between SBMs with an integrated Medicaid, CHIP, and Marketplace eligibility system and those with an account transfer process to better represent the percentage of QHP selections in relation to applicable consumers received and processed by the relevant SBM. State-specific variations are:      \r\n- Maine\u2019s data and Nevada\u2019s April and May data report all applications with Medicaid\/CHIP denials or terminations, not only those part of the annual renewal process. \r\n- Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Washington also report applications with consumers determined ineligible for Medicaid\/CHIP due to procedural reasons.\r\n- Minnesota and New York report on eligibility and enrollment for their Basic Health Programs.\r\n- Idaho\u2019s April data on consumers eligible for a QHP with financial assistance do not depict a direct correlation to consumers with a QHP selection. \r\n- Pennsylvania conducts automatic QHP eligibility determinations for Marketplace plans for some account transfers. As of the December 2023 report, Pennsylvania revised its data to report those consumers in the account transfer and application metrics.  \r\n- Only SBMs with an automatic plan assignment process have and report automatic QHP selections. These SBMs make automatic plan assignments into a QHP for a subset of individuals and provide a notification of options regarding active selection of an alternative plan and\/or, if applicable, making the first month\u2019s premium payment.  \u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cli\u003ESBMs report on all applicable applications received and not on the Medicaid-defined cohorts of individuals whose renewal is due in a given month. The data in this table are not cumulative and they count unique Marketplace activities during the reporting period month in which the relevant activity occurs. As such, activities by any one consumer may be included across reporting months. For example, a consumer who submits an application and receives a determination of QHP eligibility may be counted in one month but their plan selection could be counted in a later month. Thus, the percentages do not necessarily depict a direct correlation to the count of consumers on applications received during the current reporting month. Total counts represent activity across the reporting months and are not cumulative as of the latest reporting month. Updated applications in the reporting month are only counted once. Updated applications in a following month may be counted again in that applicable month only if the consumer obtains a new Medicaid\/CHIP renewal.\u003C\/li\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cli\u003E SBMs have different operational processes and eligibility systems for handling QHP, Medicaid and CHIP eligibility determinations. While CMS works with SBMs to align the metric definitions across the Marketplaces there can be limitations and anomalies among the SBM data due to different SBM system capabilities. Additionally, variance in the data may be attributable to differences in how states are conducting unwinding renewals including processing timelines and whether states are staging applications for population cohorts (e.g., over age 65).\u003C\/li\u003E\u003C\/ol\u003E\t\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\r\nPercentages shown are of consumers on applications whose Medicaid\/CHIP coverage was denied or terminated following renewal during the reporting period month.\u003Cbr\/\u003E\r\nPercentages shown are of consumers on account transfers whose Medicaid\/CHIP coverage was denied or terminated following renewal during the reporting period month.
